# The Complete Classics Roadmap


-----

## I. GRAMMAR In depth

### Readings

1. **Aelius Donatus, _Ars Minor_** (complete; short catechism of parts of speech).

2. **Donatus, _Ars Maior_** (selections):
    - _De barbarismo et soloecismo_ (faults of word and syntax)
    - _De tropis et schematibus_ (figures of speech)

3. **Priscian, _Institutiones Grammaticae_** (focus):
    - **Bk XVII–XVIII (_De Constructione_)** on syntax (core)
    - Skim **Bk I–II** on sounds/letters only to understand the traditional categories.
### Outcomes

- Know the **eight parts of speech** and how sentences are built.
- Distinguish **word‑level faults** (barbarism) and **syntax‑level faults** (solecism).
- Name and use core **figures of speech** (e.g., anaphora, antithesis, chiasmus, asyndeton).
- Produce precise **genus + differentia** definitions (bridge to logic).

## II. LOGIC — Aristotle’s _Organon_ in depth

### Reading sequence

1. **Categories**

- Turn a syllogism into an enthymeme (short persuasive version). 
- Identify the top 10 fallacies (equivocation, strawman, hasty generalization, etc.). 
- Invent reasons using topoi (definition, cause, comparison, circumstance).

## III. RHETORIC — Cicero & Quintilian (in English)

### Readings (order)

1. **Cicero, _Topica_** (bridge from dialectic to invention).
    
2. **Cicero, _De Inventione_** _(or_ **Partitiones Oratoriae** _if you want the concise catechism)_.
    
3. **Quintilian, _Institutio Oratoria_** (start **Bk X**, then **Bk I–II**, **Bk VIII–IX**, **Bk XII**).
    
4. **Cicero, _De Oratore_** (the full philosophy of the complete orator).
    
5. _(Optional)_ **Cicero, _Orator_** (style & rhythm), **Cicero, _Brutus_** (models & history).
    

### Outcomes

- Use **stasis** and **topoi** to invent arguments.
- Arrange a speech: **exordium → narratio → partitio → confirmatio → refutatio → peroratio**.
- Control **style** (plain/middle/grand), sentence shape (loose/periodic), and figures.
- Revise for **clarity, emphasis, rhythm**, and audience.

### Exercises

###### Progymnasmata
- These build foundational skills
- Do my Progymnasmata tutor

**R1. Stasis sheet (one issue).**  
Pick a real question (policy, value, definition). Fill a 1‑page stasis worksheet:

- **Conjectural** (What happened? What facts?)
    
- **Definitional** (What is it? To what genus does it belong?)
    
- **Qualitative** (Is it just/expedient/beneficial?)
    
- **Translative** (Is this the right forum/time/authority?)  
    End with a **precise question** you will argue (_status determinatus_).  
    _Portfolio:_ your filled sheet.
    

**R2. Topica to outline (Cicero’s _Topica_ → outline).**  
From R1, build an outline with at least **five loci** explicitly labeled (e.g., _from definition_, _from cause_, _from analogy_). Mark which points are **probable** vs **necessary**.

**R3. Draft a short oration (800–1200 words).**  
Write all six parts of the classical oration listed above.

- Constraint: every **confirmatio** paragraph must use a distinct **locus** from your outline.
    
- Include one targeted **refutatio** of an opposing argument.
    

**R4. Style pass (two revisions).**

- **Pass A (clarity)**: eliminate ambiguity, tighten referents, cut nominalizations where possible.
    
- **Pass B (figures & rhythm)**: add at least **five** figures (label them in margin notes); revise your **peroratio** into one **periodic sentence** that would sound good aloud.
    

**R5. Delivery check.**  
Read the oration aloud (5–7 minutes). Note where you stumble or the energy dips; adjust sentence length, emphasis, and transitions.

**R6. Imitation (Quintilian X).**  
Choose a brief admired passage in English (e.g., a statesman’s paragraph). Write a **200–300 word imitation** that mirrors its arrangement and rhythm while changing content.

### Checkpoint R — Rhetoric Mastery

Advance when you can:

- Produce a complete **stasis sheet** and a **Topica‑labeled outline** (R1–R2).
    
- Deliver a coherent **oration draft** with the six parts present and **≥ 5 figures** correctly used (R3–R4).
    
- Perform the **delivery check** (R5) and submit a **200–300 word imitation** (R6).  
    **Deliverable:** Rhetoric Portfolio (R1–R6).

# Philosophy

1. **Plato – _Apology_, _Crito_, _Meno_ (or _Gorgias_)**  
    _Why:_ Launchpad for ethics, knowledge, and rhetoric (Socrates vs. sophists).  
    _If short on time:_ _Apology_ + _Meno_.
    
2. **Plato – _Republic_ (Bk I–II, IV, VII)**  
    _Why:_ Justice, the soul, education, forms; core political philosophy.  
    _Tip:_ Read Bk I like a debate warm‑up; Bk VII (Cave) shapes the rest.
    
3. **Aristotle – _Nicomachean Ethics_ (Bk I–III, VI, X)**  
    _Why:_ Virtue, deliberation, happiness; antidote to purely rule‑based ethics.
    
4. **Aristotle – _Politics_ (Bk I–III)**  
    _Why:_ Natural foundations of community, constitutions, citizenship.
    
5. **Epicurus – _Letter to Menoeceus_ & _Principal Doctrines_**  
    _Why:_ Pleasure, fear, and prudence—brief, clarifying, humane.
    
6. **Epictetus – _Enchiridion_ (with a few _Discourses_)**  
    _Why:_ Control vs. concern; practical moral psychology for daily life.
    
7. **Seneca – _Letters_ (1, 7, 47, 71, 104) + _On Tranquillity of Mind_**  
    _Why:_ Stoic ethics in action; friendships, anger, time, status.
    
8. **Augustine – _Confessions_ (Bk I, VIII, X)**  
    _Why:_ Interiority, will, memory; bridges ancient to medieval thought.
    
9. **Descartes – _Meditations_**  
    _Why:_ Modern epistemology’s reset: methodical doubt, mind/body, God.
    
10. **Hume – _Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_**  
    _Why:_ Causation, induction, miracles; skeptical pressure test for reason.
    
11. **Kant – _Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals_** (+ “What Is Enlightenment?”)  
    _Why:_ Duty, autonomy, dignity; a new foundation for moral law.  
    _Tip:_ If the prose bites, read the Preface → Section I → Section II.
    
12. **Nietzsche – _On the Genealogy of Morals_**  
    _Why:_ Values’ origins; critique of guilt, punishment, ascetic ideals.

# Theology

**0. The New Testament (one slot: _Luke–Acts_ + _Romans_)**  
The storyline of Jesus & the early church + the densest statement of Christian theology. Read this first so everything else has a map.

**1) Athanasius — _On the Incarnation_**  
Short, crystalline case for why the Word became flesh; anchors Trinity/Christology in the early church.

**2) Augustine — _Confessions_**  
Interior life, grace, and desire; shows how doctrine meets experience (pair with Book X for memory and God).

**3) Anselm — _Cur Deus Homo_**  
A compact medieval answer to “Why the God‑man?”—atonement and fittingness reasoning.

**4) Thomas Aquinas — _Compendium of Theology_** _(Aquinas’s own short summary)_  
The clearest single‑volume gateway to the medieval synthesis (God, creation, providence, virtues).

**5) Reformation voice (pick one):**

- **Luther — _The Freedom of a Christian_** (brief, programmatic), **or**
    
- **Calvin — _Institutes_ (read Book I + a few chapters from Book III)** for a systematic Reformed view.

**6) 20th‑century dogmatics (pick one):**

- **Karl Barth — _Dogmatics in Outline_** (the Apostles’ Creed as living system), **or**
    
- **Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) — _Introduction to Christianity_** (modern, lucid creed‑by‑creed account).
    

> **Result:** With 5–7 slim books (counting the NT as one “slot”), you’ll see the arc: Scripture → early creeds → Augustinian depth → medieval synthesis → Reformation → modern dogmatics.

#### B) Single‑author shortcut (Aquinas in 2 works)

If you’d rather learn one master well:

1. **Aquinas — _Compendium of Theology_** (the concise overview).
    
2. **Aquinas — _Summa Theologiae_ (targeted treatises):**
    
    - **On God & how we speak of God:** I, qq. 1–13
        
    - **Providence & will:** I, qq. 22–26
        
    - **Happiness & law (ethics at the core of theology):** I–II, qq. 1–5 and 90–97
        
    - **Christ (Incarnation):** III, qq. 1–26 (skim key questions)
        

> **Result:** Two Aquinas books, read selectively, give you a cohesive system with minimal duplication.
