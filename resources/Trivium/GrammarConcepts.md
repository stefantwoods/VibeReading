The Foundation (memorize these cold):

The 10 Categories: Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, State, Action, Passion
The semantic triangle: Thing → Concept → Word (and how these relate)
Universal vs. Particular terms (man vs. Socrates)
Substantive vs. Attributive (what things are vs. how they are)

Parts of Speech (just the core functions):

Noun/Pronoun: names substances
Verb: expresses existence/action/passion
Adjective/Adverb: express attributes
Conjunction: shows logical relationships (and/or/but/if-then)
Preposition: shows relations
Skip the subdivisions unless they come up in logic later

Key Distinctions:

Concrete vs. Abstract (man vs. humanity)
Proper vs. Common nouns (this matters for logical propositions)
Finite vs. Infinite verbs (critical for identifying propositions)
Copula (the verb "to be" when it links subject and predicate)

Sentence Level:

Subject-Predicate structure
Simple vs. Complex sentences
What makes something a proposition (can be true/false)

That's it. Everything else - the types of pronouns, verb moods beyond indicative, gerundives, etc. - just skim for awareness. You'll recognize them if they become relevant later, but they won't be.
The test: Can you take any sentence and identify what category each important word points to, whether terms are universal or particular, and what logical relationship the conjunctions imply? If yes, you're ready for logic.
