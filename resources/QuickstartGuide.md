## My current process (subject to change)

##### Before/while reading
    - I like to prime myself if necessary
        - I use AI and notebookLM to create anki flashcards for difficult terms found in each chapter and review before I begin the chapter

##### Read current book group is reading
    - I like to take notes while reading summarizing things I think are useful
    - Using a socratic mentor is helpful to explain difficult portions in the book (I'll have to add that)

##### AI Mentors
    - Start each conversation with begin sessions or session 1 to start exercises
    - Each mentor is made to generate a log at the end of each session
        - Copy paste this log into the projects (AI mentor's) context bank so that it can keep track of your progress
        - !! Change to logging system: should now only keep logs until you progress to the next stage with the tutor, the tutor will give you an advancement log which you store in context bank. Then delete all the other logs

##### AI mentor uses
    - Grammar is made for our current book the trivium
        - Structured by chapter so session 1 teaches ch1 till your ready for the concepts in ch2
        - Will create logic and rhetoric coaches for later chapters
    - MemoryPalace is a weekly practice to help you create/maintain memory palance
        - Should supplement our readings nicely
    - Progymnasmata is classical writing exercises that compliment the trivium
        - These should be done 3-4 times a week
        - I'm doing 2 quick sessions (20mins) and 1 standard session (30mins) a week personally
    - SocialGraces is for being less autistic (be able to be educated and not insufferable)
        - Should ideally do this once a day (they are quick 10min exercises/lessons)
    -  WritingStyles is writing exercises that should be done after Progymnasmata
        - This will develop your prose/style to make you an even better writer/thinker
        - Same practice schedule as Progymnasmata

##### How to setup AI mentors
    - Claude/ChatGPT both have "projects"
    - In projects add the AI tutor .md file to the instruction portion
    - In the "files" section add the logs/roadmap/any necessary context the ai will need

    - !!! new process if the AI mentor has mulitple files (fill probably be most of them in the future)
        - The masterPrompt should go in the project instructions
        - The "Docs" should go into the context bank of the AI
            - !IMPORTANT name the docs the same as the name of the file (ex: Doc 1: Exercise...)
